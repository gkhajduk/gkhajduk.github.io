             <p>This post is part of a <a href="/2016-09-26-fieldwork-tips-series/">Fieldwork Tips</a> series.</p>

<p>NOTE: In this post I refer to other posts in this series (using [square brackets]) - those posts don’t exist yet, I will add links to them when they appear on the site.</p>

<h2 id="intro">Intro</h2>

<p>Kit has to be tailored to your needs, trip, project… So it is impossible to provide you with the perfect packing list. However, I thought that I can give you a list that’s a mix of items I’ve used over different projects and things I always take with me for climbing trips (minus the climbing gear). You most likely won’t need all of this - but it might be worth a read through anyway as some things are less obvious than others. There is always one or two I’d have forgotten if it wasn’t for the list!</p>

<p>Since the list itself is a rather dry read I thought that first I’d highlight a few things that might not make immediate sense. The full packing list follows.</p>

<h2 id="general-advice">General advice</h2>

<ul>
  <li>Whatever you take, make sure you know how to use it! It is particularly important that you know how to use your survival gear, map and compass (don’t rely on a fancy GPS!), especially if your fieldwork takes you somewhere remote. Check out my [tips on experience and training for the fieldwork] too.</li>
  <li>Packing list presented below is long, but pack wisely and as light as you can, especially if you have to carry a lot of your kit around for prolonged periods of time. Do a dry run - pack your rucksack, put it on and go for a walk. If you start aching by the time you move through the house you need to re-think a few items!</li>
  <li>Be inventive! Try to take things that are versatile. Make sure you can fix simple problems with items you will have on you (duct tape and super glue are often a life saver!). Hopefully a few items from the list will give you some ideas in this department.</li>
  <li>Make sure to minimise your impact on the environment, especially in places that are remote and where waste is hard to dispose of properly. You can get biodegradable shampoos and shower gels and even wet wipes - just make sure to check as most aren’t. Have a look at my [tips on being in the field] and [field hygiene].</li>
  <li>If access to water is intermittent or unreliable you might want to invest in personal cleansing products that don’t require water - there are dry shampoos, no rinse soaps, body washes and sprays that don’t require any water out there. You should be able to find something suitable.</li>
  <li>Insect repellent - DEET is strong, be careful: in higher concentration it will melt plastic… And so possibly damage your belongings. My friend melted his socks onto his boots! Also depending on your work, e.g. if you work with animals or collect samples where chemical composition is important, you might not be able to use it all. Citronella is a good alternative. <em>Avon skin so soft</em> works wonders with Scottish midges and might be worth a try. If the repellent is in a spray form use it on your clothes, not your skin, it will last longer, as you won’t sweat it off right away.</li>
  <li>Rucksack. If you are going to carry a lot of kit all the time a quality backpack that distributes weight well is a must. Since I hardly have to carry anything during my current fieldwork I have replaced the rucksack with a waist bag to take the weight completely off my bad shoulder.</li>
  <li>When you pack double check what you have put in your carry on. I’ve been known to forget to take my pocket knife out of my rucksack before attempting to board a plane…</li>
  <li>Bring a comfort item or two - it’s nice to have something you like, something that can make you feel better when you are poorly/homesick/lonely. A favourite book, or a snuggly pullover or favourite chocolate/tea…</li>
</ul>

<p>Generally I’d advise that the more remote the fieldsite the more you need to bring, especially focusing on the essentials if you can’t get those easily. You won’t be happy if you lose your only toothbrush and can’t get to a shop for a week!</p>

<h2 id="dont-bring">Don’t bring</h2>

<p>Ironically some items I list here also appear on the packing list… Why are they on both “take” and “don’t take”? To make you think twice! So much depends on where you are going and what you can buy once there.</p>

<p>For example, if you are going to be close to civilisation there isn’t much point in taking lots of shampoo, shower gel, laundry detergent etc. When I travel to Oz I pack some toothpaste for the plane and a tiny hotel-sized shower gel. This means I can have a shower at the airport and/or one when I get in without having to wait till I make it to the shops, but at the same time I’m not lugging bottles of stuff across the world for no reason. On the other hand if you are going somewhere more remote you might be able to get some shower gel, but might not be able to get dry shampoo or no-rinse soap or biodegradable stuff. So bring those.</p>

<p>Don’t bring unnecessary bulky electrical items like a hairdryer. I also don’t bother with make up. Bring an e-reader instead of books. Money belt - I see it recommended a lot, but my feeling is that now thieves are aware of the trick and the first thing they go for is the belt.</p>

<h2 id="the-packing-list">The Packing List</h2>

<h3 id="essentials">Essentials</h3>

<ul>
  <li>head torch + charger/spare batteries</li>
  <li>water bottles</li>
  <li>duct tape</li>
  <li>super glue</li>
  <li>small sewing kit - simple needle and thread</li>
  <li>safety pins</li>
  <li>compass</li>
  <li>maps</li>
  <li>penknife/multitool - I have a swiss army knife</li>
  <li>water cleaning/purifying tablets</li>
  <li>ziplock bags - you can keep snacks in them (biscuits, nuts etc.), use them to keep your phone/camera dry, seal waste and so on.</li>
  <li>tweezers, nail clippers</li>
  <li>day pack - size depends on how much kit you have to carry. Make sure that it’s sturdy, padded and distributes weight comfortably if you are going to be using it extensively.</li>
  <li>quick-dry (microfibre) towel - they will smell eventually, but a high temperature wash/boiling sorts that out. I bring two.</li>
  <li>sunhat - with a wide brim or a neck protector</li>
  <li>sunglasses - otherwise you will get headaches in bright sun</li>
  <li>quick dry fieldwork-appropriate clothing - see [Fieldwork Tips: Dress for Success!]</li>
  <li>appropriate footwear - trainers, walking boots, wellies…</li>
  <li>flip flops or sandals - for campsite, grubby showers etc.</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="camping-gear">Camping gear</h3>

<p>Obviously needed if you are camping, but some items might be worth considering even if you are not.</p>

<ul>
  <li>tent</li>
  <li>sleeping mat</li>
  <li>sleeping bag - even for the tropics. Yes, you read that right. You never know where you might end up, some places can be a bit dodgy and you’ll want something between the surface and your body.</li>
  <li>stove and/or jet boil</li>
  <li>fire starter goo - just please consider where you are starting fires!</li>
  <li>collapsible big (5-10L) water jugs - good for water needed to wash pots, hands <em>etc</em>.</li>
  <li>small shovel</li>
  <li>camp chair</li>
  <li>washing line + biodegradable laundry detergent</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="electronics">Electronics</h3>

<p>Make sure you have extra batteries and all needed chargers and connectors. See also my [tips about going paperless].</p>

<ul>
  <li>adapters - some people swear by the multi-country-adapters, but I always struggle with their bulk (they don’t sit nicely in the sockets and I have had things stop charging in the middle of the night as they disconnect). I prefer slimmer single ones. If you have a lot of stuff that needs to be plugged in then…</li>
  <li>short extension cable is a great solution! You then just need one adapter for that and everything else can get plugged directly into the extension sockets.</li>
  <li>USB stick</li>
  <li>laptop and/or a tablet</li>
  <li>camera</li>
  <li>e-book reader - great if weight/space are an issue and you can’t bring a stack of books. Also good for manual/protocol back up as their batteries last for ages!</li>
  <li>unlocked phone + local sim card</li>
  <li>GPS</li>
  <li>iPod + mini-speakers - I don’t bother, but some people can’t go without music</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="data-and-sample-collection">Data and sample collection</h3>

<ul>
  <li>notebook + pen/pencil -  A lot of people are fans of Moleskine, but I find them too pricey, and also I like something waterproof for fieldwork (like <a href="http://www.riteintherain.com">Rite in the Rain</a>).</li>
  <li>hand lens</li>
  <li>marker pens</li>
  <li>masking tape</li>
  <li>containers for specimens - tubes, petri dishes etc.</li>
  <li>small tupperware and ziplock bags often come in handy too</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="medicine-first-aid-etc">Medicine, first aid etc.</h3>

<p>Consult your doctor if in doubt about any medication! Below are just some ideas of the types of products worth considering. I find that it’s better to put together your own first aid kit than rely on bought ones.</p>

<p>Make sure all medicines are within their use-by dates. If you are not great with first aid keep a basic manual with your kit.</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>(!!!)</strong> make sure you bring enough prescribed medication to last you for the trip and then some, just in case you have to extend your stay. This could include inhalers, epipens, anti-depressants <em>etc</em>.</li>
  <li>painkillers</li>
  <li>plasters - variety of sizes/shapes</li>
  <li>bandages</li>
  <li>sterile dressings</li>
  <li>safety pins</li>
  <li>anti-malarials if needed</li>
  <li>rehydration sachets</li>
  <li>diarrhoea treatment e.g. imodium or pepto</li>
  <li>insect repellent - with DEET/citronella</li>
  <li>antihistamine - tablets or cream</li>
  <li>cortisol cream/ointment or aloe vera - good for itchy skin (bites, rashes, mild burns)</li>
  <li>antiseptic/biocidal cleansing - swabs/wipes work well, I also normally carry a small bottle/spray or gel</li>
  <li>tweezers - I found those essential around cacti</li>
  <li>scissors - or make sure your multi-tool has those in</li>
  <li>tape - a bit of duct tape might be fine</li>
  <li>distilled water</li>
  <li>eye wash</li>
  <li>cough medicine</li>
  <li>clean needle kit if you are traveling somewhere were hospitals leave a bit to be desired</li>
  <li>super glue - this is not something I recommend you use a lot, but fellow climbers will know that sometimes glueing your skin back together is a life saver</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="toiletries">Toiletries</h3>

<p>Make sure to minimise your impact on the environment - go biodegradable!</p>

<ul>
  <li>toothbrush - if you are somewhere remote bring two!</li>
  <li>toothpase</li>
  <li>shampoo - dry shampoo is a good back up if your access to water is likely to be intermittent and/or unreliable</li>
  <li>bodywash - as above, no rinse soap might be handy</li>
  <li>wet wipes</li>
  <li>suncream</li>
  <li>lip balm with SPF</li>
  <li>aftersun/aloe vera</li>
  <li>talc powder - if you are going somewhere particularly wet and especially if your feet will spend majority of their time in working boots</li>
  <li>contraception</li>
  <li>feminine products - I’d suggest menstrual cup - have a look at my [tips on hygiene in the field]</li>
  <li>antibacterial gel - essential in the field</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="miscellaneous">Miscellaneous</h3>

<ul>
  <li>dry bags - I got some cheap ones and they have been really handy - both to keep things dry and to keep wet things contained! If I get caught in the rain I pop my valuables in, or if I’m going swimming I can keep the swimsuit/wet towel from getting everything else in the rucksack soggy.</li>
  <li>sleeping bag liner - for extra warmth in cold conditions, can be used to store clothes away or keep you separated from grubby sheets/mattress.</li>
  <li>mosquito net and head net</li>
  <li>binoculars</li>
  <li>local sim card</li>
  <li>bear-spray?</li>
  <li>power bars, nuts (cashews, almonds - good source of protein)</li>
  <li>packing cubes - awesome for space saving and organising, as well as containing items once you unpack</li>
  <li>handkerchiefs</li>
  <li>light scarf (can cover hair if needed or dress up a simple top)</li>
  <li>tea</li>
  <li>coffee making device e.g. a small french press if you are the type that needs caffeination</li>
  <li>thermos</li>
  <li>earplugs if you are a light sleeper</li>
  <li>sleep mask</li>
  <li>toilet paper - just make sure you pack it out if you use it in the field or dig really deep</li>
  <li>trash bags</li>
  <li>watch, preferably waterproof one, that shows seconds</li>
</ul>
